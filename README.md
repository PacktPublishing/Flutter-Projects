**A practical, project-based guide to building real-world cross-platform mobile applications and games**

## What is this book about?
Flutter is a modern reactive mobile framework that removes a lot of the complexity found in building native mobile apps for iOS and Android. With Flutter, developers can now build fast and native mobile apps from a single codebase.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Design reusable mobile architectures that can be applied to apps at any scale
* Get up to speed with error handling and debugging for mobile application development
* Apply the principle of ‘composition over inheritance’ to break down complex problems into many simple problems
* Update your code and see the results immediately using Flutter’s hot reload
* Identify and prevent bugs from reappearing with Flutter’s developer tools
* Manage an app's state with Streams and the BLoC pattern
* Build a simple web application using Flutter Web
